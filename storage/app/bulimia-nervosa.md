# What is Bulimia: Symptoms, Complications, & Causes
Bulimia Nervosa is a troubling mental illness and eating disorder that can have severe lifetime consequences. For those that struggle with this disorder, overcoming the complicated behaviors of the disorder as well as the misperceptions and stigmas associated with it can be incredibly difficult.

Approximately 1% of individuals with bulimia nervosa will struggle for their lifetime. Increasing awareness of symptoms, causes, and interventions of bulimia nervosa can result in a meaningful reduction of this prevalence.

Bulimia Meaning
---------------

The term “bulimia nervosa” refers to an eating disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating that are followed by compensatory behaviors such as purging, fasting, and/or excessive exercise.

### Bulimia Definition According to the DSM-5

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) defines the diagnostic criteria that must be met for an individual to be diagnosed with a specific mental illness.

For bulimia nervosa, the DSM-5 specifies the following criteria:

1.  Recurrent episodes of binge eating, which are characterized by BOTH of the following

*   “Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances.
*   A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g. a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).

2.  Recurrent, inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.
3.  The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.
4.  Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.
5.  The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa \[1\].

### ICD-10 Code for Bulimia Nervosa

Each culture varies in its medical and mental health diagnostic terminology. For this reason, the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) designates specific codes that allow diagnoses to be communicated regardless of cultural differences.

The ICD-10 code for Bulimia Nervosa is F50.2

Bulimia Statistics

While many are aware of bulimia, the impact it has on various populations, as well as its prevalence, is less known.

*   .3% of the US population will struggle with bulimia in their lifetime \[2\].
*   4% of females in the US will experience bulimia nervosa, which is 5X that of males \[3\] \[2\].
*   78% of those with bulimia nervosa experience daily life impairment and 43.9% experience severe impairment \[2\].
*   Only 43% of those with bulimia nervosa receive treatment \[2\].
*   3.9% of those with bulimia nervosa will die from their disorder \[4\].

### Types of Bulimia Nervosa

Due to the complexity of Bulimia Nervosa symptoms and behaviors, they are often divided into two subtypes: Purging Type and Non-Purging Type.

### Purging Type

Bulimia Nervosa – Purging Type refers to the most commonly understood version of Bulimia Nervosa behaviors. Purging Type involves the individual engaging in the above-mentioned binge eating behaviors followed by purging behaviors such as vomiting and/or laxative/diuretics/enemas.

### Non-Purging Type

Bulimia Nervosa – Non-Purging Type does not mean that individuals do not engage in compensatory behaviors intended to “undo” binge-eating behaviors. Those that struggle with non-purging bulimia engage in compensatory behaviors that do not actively involve expelling the food from the body. Instead, these individuals will engage in fasting or exercising behaviors to compensate and do not regularly engage in purging behaviors if they do at all.

Bulimia Nervosa Symptoms
------------------------

The best way to combat bulimia and increase the likelihood of long-term recovery is early intervention. This begins with early detection through awareness of symptoms and signs of bulimia.

Physical Signs

Bulimia Nervosa is an intensely physical disorder, resulting in apparent changes to the body that can warn an individual is struggling, such as:

*   Weight fluctuations.
*   Chronically inflamed or sore throat.
*   Swollen salivary glands around the neck and jaw.
*   Worn tooth enamel/yellowing teeth and tooth sensitivity due to exposure to stomach acid.
*   “Acid reflux disorder and other gastrointestinal problems \[5\].”
*   “Intestinal distress and irritation from laxative abuse \[5\].”
*   Severe dehydration due to fluid loss from purging.
*   Electrolyte Imbalance.

What are the Causes of Bulimia?
-------------------------------

As with most mental illnesses and eating disorders, there is no one cause of bulimia nervosa. Numerous factors related to one’s genetic make-up, environmental and social upbringing, and psychological history can lead to bulimia nervosa behaviors.

Biological Factors

### Biological Factors

There are a few genetic and biological factors that are associated with the development of bulimia nervosa, such as:

*   Family history of eating disorders/bulimia nervosa.
*   Family history of mental illness/substance use.
*   Predisposition to impulsivity/impulse control difficulties.
*   Predisposition to binge eating.
*   Neural sensitivity to rewards, particularly food reward systems.

Psychological Factors

Psychological Factors
---------------------

Bulimia nervosa is associated with specific behavioral pathology, including:

*   Prior mental health diagnosis.
*   Tendency for impulsivity.
*   History of abuse or trauma.
*   Negative body image or self image.
*   Impaired emotion regulation and distress tolerance capabilities.
*   Poor self-esteem.
*   Engaging in a career or hobby focused on physical appearance.

Dieting Factors

### Dieting Factors

Development of bulimia nervosa is closely associated with a history of dieting and engagement in diet culture behaviors, some of which include:

*   Dissatisfaction with body weight/shape/size.
*   Negative self-view related to appearance.
*   Any history of dieting behaviors.
*   Any history of engaging in restricting and bingeing cycles.
*   Overvaluation of eurocentric beauty ideals.
*   Core beliefs equating fulfillment with appearance.

Bulimia Nervosa Treatment Options
---------------------------------

There are various therapeutic modalities recommended to treat bulimia nervosa that are proven to be effective. One of these is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which focuses on the limiting and unhelpful beliefs one might have that fuel bulimic behaviors and supports the individual in replacing these with beliefs that support recovery. Family-based therapy is also particularly helpful in treating eating disorders in adolescents and young adults. Additionally, many individuals with bulimia nervosa struggle with co-occurring disorders that might perpetuate bulimia behaviors, therefore, seeking out information regarding psychiatric medication may provide mood stabilization that results in behavior reduction.

It is true that the behaviors and potential consequences of bulimia nervosa are frightening, however, do not forget that this disorder is treatable. It is possible to receive meaningful and life-changing support that allows you or your loved one to become free of this disorder and live a fulfilled and joyful life of recovery.
